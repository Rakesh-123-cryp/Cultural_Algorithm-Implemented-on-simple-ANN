Accuracy of the model ~ 95%

CA is also a kind of genetic algorithm with the concept of beliefes that decide how the population improves. This is a self-sustainable population due to the constant change in beliefes togather with the population. Unlike genetic the population need not be fixed and can have variable population. Still produced lesser accuracy than PSO.
